# Cryptographic Protocols Project

ðŸ“Œ For the subject of Cryptographic Protocols, we have to use ProVerif to verify security properties of one protocol

## Oct 30
* It is from one of the properties, Authentication and Confidentiality
* First differentiate between these two.
* Look at the sample code in the manual for an idea.
* Check the chosen paper for code.
* We will try to verify confidentiality as it is given in the paper already

## Oct 31

Found some papers that have code
*  [For KDC + other](https://hal.science/hal-01689790/document) or [alternate link](https://sancy.iut.uca.fr/~lafourcade/PAPERS/PDF/BLGR17.pdf)
*  [Papers using ProVerif](https://bblanche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/proverif/proverif-users.html)
*  [ProVerif online demo](http://proverif20.paris.inria.fr/index.php)
*  [Maybe useful](https://journalofcloudcomputing.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13677-023-00464-0)

Realized, I just have to add Needhamâ€“Schroeder protocol to the paper
